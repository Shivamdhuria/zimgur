# zimgur
An android client for Imgur in Kotlin using MVVM and Material Components.

To get this to run your computer, you need to register the App on [Imgur](https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/addclient).
After registering you'll get a **Client ID** and a **Client Secret Key***.

Create a file named **secrets.properties** in root folder and copy this in.
```
IMGUR_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID = "xxxxxxx..."
IMGUR_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET = "xxxxxxxxxxx..."
```
and replace the xxxx with the Client ID and the Client Secret Key you got from registering at Imgur.
